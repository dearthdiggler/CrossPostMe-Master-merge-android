# iOS App Development Starter

## Prerequisites

- Xcode installed (latest version recommended)
- macOS system
- Basic knowledge of Swift and iOS development

This folder is for your iOS app code. Recommended files to port or reference from your project:

- API models: `CrossPostMe/models.py`
- API client logic: `CrossPostMe/services/`, `CrossPostMe/routes/`
- Shared assets: `CrossPostMe/public/`, `app/frontend/src/components/`
- Documentation: `CrossPostMe/docs/`, `CrossPostMe/ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG.md`

For a cross-platform app, consider using Flutter or React Native. You can port logic from Python/JS to Swift (iOS) or Dart (Flutter).

Start by copying over:

- API specs and models
- Any reusable business logic
- UI assets (icons, images)
- Documentation

Let me know if you want a full starter template for Flutter or React Native!
